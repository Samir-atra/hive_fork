## Summary

Adds a new Support Debugger agent template that demonstrates cyclic investigation workflows for support debugging scenarios.

### Key Features

- **5-Node Graph**: build-context → generate-hypotheses → investigate → refine-hypotheses → generate-response
- **Cyclic Investigation Loop**: Uses `EdgeCondition.CONDITIONAL` to loop between investigate and refine-hypotheses nodes
- **Confidence-Based Convergence**: Investigation continues until a hypothesis reaches 0.8+ confidence or iteration limits are reached
- **Safety Bounds**: `max_node_visits=5` on the investigate node prevents infinite loops
- **Tool-Agnostic Evidence Gathering**: 5 stub tools demonstrating extension points for real backend integrations:
  - `fetch_ticket_details` - Issue tracking system integration
  - `search_logs` - Log aggregation system integration  
  - `search_documentation` - Knowledge base integration
  - `get_system_metrics` - Monitoring system integration
  - `get_recent_deployments` - CI/CD system integration
- **Comprehensive Tests**: 20 structural tests validating graph topology, loop termination, and conditional routing

### Graph Flow

```
build-context → generate-hypotheses → investigate → refine-hypotheses → generate-response
                                    ^                      |
                                    +---- investigation loop (if continue_investigation=true)
```

### Implementation Details

- No changes to core/framework - this is purely an additive template
- Uses Pydantic-style structured outputs for data contracts between nodes
- Follows the forever-alive pattern (no terminal nodes, cycles back to intake)
- Client-facing nodes: build-context (intake), generate-response (delivery)

### Testing

All 20 structural tests pass:
- Agent structure validation
- Goal success criteria and constraints
- Tools module validation
- Graph topology verification

Resolves #4050
