## Summary
- Add comprehensive test suite for `core/framework/graph/safe_eval.py` with 166 test cases
- Cover all security-critical functionality including literals, operators, data structures, function calls, and security boundaries
- Test real-world EdgeSpec.condition_expr patterns used by the graph executor

## Test Coverage

The test suite covers:
- **Literals and Constants**: integers, floats, strings, booleans, None
- **Data Structures**: lists, tuples, dicts (empty, nested, mixed)
- **Arithmetic Operators**: +, -, *, /, //, %, **
- **Bitwise Operators**: <<, >>, |, ^, &
- **Comparison Operators**: ==, !=, <, <=, >, >=, is, is not, in, not in
- **Unary Operators**: -, +, not, ~
- **Boolean Operators**: and, or
- **Ternary Expressions**: `true_val if test else false_val`
- **Variable Lookup**: simple variables, missing variables
- **Subscript Access**: list/tuple index, dict key access, nested access
- **Attribute Access**: string methods (upper, lower, strip, split), dict methods (get, keys, values, items)
- **Whitelisted Functions**: len, int, float, str, bool, list, dict, tuple, set, min, max, sum, abs, round, all, any
- **Whitelisted Methods**: get, keys, values, items, lower, upper, strip, split
- **Security Boundaries**: 
  - Private attribute access blocked
  - Lambda expressions blocked
  - Dangerous builtins (eval, exec, open, compile, __import__) blocked
  - Statement constructs (def, class, assignment) blocked
  - Comprehensions blocked
  - Await/yield blocked
- **EdgeSpec.condition_expr patterns**: Real-world usage patterns from graph executor

## Impact
Prevents silent regressions in a security-sensitive sandbox component that is used for evaluating edge conditions in the graph executor.

Resolves #4018
