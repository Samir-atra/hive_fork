## Summary
- Fixed `csv_read` silently losing data when CSV files contain duplicate column names
- Added duplicate column detection that returns an error with the list of duplicate columns
- Added unit tests for single and multiple duplicate column scenarios

## Problem
Python's `csv.DictReader` overwrites values for duplicate keys in dictionaries. When a CSV file has duplicate column names (e.g., `name,name,age`), the `csv_read` function would silently lose data from the earlier columns without any warning to the user.

## Solution
Added duplicate column detection before reading CSV data. If duplicate column names are found:
- The function immediately returns an error response
- The error message lists all duplicate column names
- The user is informed that column names must be unique

## Example
Before fix:
```python
# CSV file: name,name,age
# Alice,Smith,30
# Bob,Jones,25
# Result: silently loses first "name" column data
```

After fix:
```python
# Returns error:
# "Duplicate column names detected: name. CSV file has duplicate column names 
#  which would result in data loss. Please ensure all column names are unique."
```

## Files Changed
- `tools/src/aden_tools/tools/csv_tool/csv_tool.py` - Added duplicate column detection
- `tools/tests/tools/test_csv_tool.py` - Added tests for duplicate column handling

## Testing
- All 51 existing tests continue to pass
- Added 2 new tests for duplicate column scenarios

Resolves #2153
