# Migrate Architecture Diagrams to Mermaid Format

Closes #4181

## Summary

Converts all ASCII box-drawing character diagrams across documentation to Mermaid syntax. Mermaid diagrams render natively on GitHub more reliably than ASCII art (which breaks with font differences, mobile views, and narrow viewports) and are easier to maintain and update.

**Total: 34 diagrams converted.**

## Motivation

- **Rendering reliability** — ASCII box-drawing characters (`┌ ─ ┐ │ └ ┘`) depend on monospace font alignment. They break on mobile, in narrow viewports, and with proportional fonts. Mermaid renders as SVGs that scale correctly everywhere.
- **Maintainability** — Editing a Mermaid flowchart means changing a text label; editing ASCII art means re-aligning dozens of characters.
- **Accessibility** — Mermaid diagrams are interactive on GitHub (expandable, zoomable) and convey structure semantically rather than relying on visual character placement.

## Verification

- Grep confirms zero remaining `┌` box-drawing characters in `docs/` and `core/README.md` (excluding `i18n/` and directory tree listings using `├──`).
- No code changes — documentation only.
- No test impact.
