# 🐝 Hive Agentic Platform: Overview & Usage

## What is Hive?

**Hive** is a premium, graph-based agentic framework designed to turn high-level goals into executable AI workflows. Unlike simple chatbots, Hive operates by "architecting" a decision-making graph where nodes represent specific logic (LLM reasoning, tool usage, or Python functions) and edges define the flow based on outcomes.

### Core Architecture
1.  **The Goal Studio**: A higher-level interface where users describe *what* they want.
2.  **The Builder (Architect)**: An LLM (like Gemini 2.5 Flash) that analyzes the goal and constructs a directed graph of nodes.
3.  **The Runtime**: The engine that executes the graph, managing shared memory, tool calls, and state persistence.
4.  **MCP Integration**: Native support for the **Model Context Protocol**, allowing agents to use hundreds of external tools (GitHub, Web Search, Databases) out of the box.

## Example: GitHub Discovery Agent

This example demonstrates how Hive handles a request to find and summarize technical issues.

### 1. The Input (Input Data)
The user provides a natural language prompt in the **Goal Studio**:
> *"Find issues in the 'microsoft/vscode' repository labeled 'extension-host' that have been active in the last 7 days and summarize them for a weekly report."*

### 2. The Execution Flow (The Graph)
Hive's Architect generates the following graph:

| Node ID | Type | Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `analyzer` | `llm_generate` | Extracts `repo`, `label`, and `date_filter` from the user prompt. |
| `searcher` | `llm_tool_use` | Calls the `github_search_issues` tool using the extracted parameters. |
| `summarizer` | `llm_generate` | Takes the raw JSON results and transforms them into a premium Markdown report. |

### 3. The Output (The Final Result)
Hive produces a structured output stored in its shared memory. The final visual output to the user would look like this:

## Why Use Hive?

- **Visual Intelligence**: Watch your agent "think" through the Live Generation view.
- **Polars Integration**: High-performance data processing for agent execution metrics.
- **Deterministic Scaling**: Define success criteria for every node to ensure reliability.
- **State Persistence**: Every decision and tool output is logged for auditing and debugging.
