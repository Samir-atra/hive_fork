## Summary
- Add `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` as the default Groq model for better tool-following capabilities
- Add `_is_tool_validation_error()` function to detect tool schema validation failures
- Provide helpful error message suggesting model upgrade when tool validation fails
- Update both `quickstart.sh` and `quickstart.ps1` with new Groq model options

## Problem
The Tech News Reporter agent crashes on Groq when using `llama-3.1-8b-instant` because the model fails to follow the strict tool schema for `set_output`, generating invalid parameter values. Groq's API returns a `ServiceUnavailableError` with a validation error message, which was being treated as a transient error and retried unnecessarily.

## Solution
1. **Upgrade default Groq model**: Changed the default Groq model from `moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct-0905` to `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`, which has better tool-following capabilities.
2. **Add tool validation detection**: Added `_is_tool_validation_error()` function to detect when an error is caused by the model generating invalid tool call parameters.
3. **Improve error messages**: When a tool validation error occurs, the error message now includes a helpful hint suggesting the user switch to a model with better tool-following capabilities.
4. **Update model options**: Added `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` as the recommended Groq model option, with Kimi K2 and GPT-OSS 120B as alternatives.

## Files Changed
- `quickstart.sh`: Updated Groq default model and model choices (Bash 4+ and 3.2 sections)
- `quickstart.ps1`: Updated Groq default model and model choices (PowerShell)
- `core/framework/llm/litellm.py`: Added `_is_tool_validation_error()` function and improved error handling in stream method

## Testing
- Verified the changes do not break existing functionality
- The error message now provides actionable guidance when tool validation fails

Resolves #4157
