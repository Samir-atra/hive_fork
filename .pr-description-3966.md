# docs: add enterprise installation guide for proxy and offline setups

Resolves #3966

## Summary

Added comprehensive documentation for enterprise installation scenarios, specifically addressing the needs of financial institutions and other organizations that require proxy-aware or offline installation paths.

## Problem

From the issue:
> The current reliance on direct public internet access (in 'quickstart.sh') is going to be a hard stop for the major financial institutions we would be targeting. Those environments almost always block direct egress and force traffic through corporate proxies. If we don't document a proxy-aware or offline install path, we risk stalling out in InfoSec reviews before the POC even starts.

## Solution

Created a new `enterprise-installation.md` guide that covers:

### Corporate Proxy Installation
- Step-by-step proxy environment variable configuration
- Git proxy configuration
- pip/uv proxy configuration
- SSL certificate handling for custom corporate CAs
- Verification steps before running quickstart

### Offline/Air-Gapped Installation
- Pre-built package method (recommended)
- Wheel-based installation method
- Playwright offline installation for web scraping tools

### Troubleshooting
- Connection timeouts
- SSL certificate errors
- Proxy authentication issues (including NTLM via cntlm)
- Partial installation failures
