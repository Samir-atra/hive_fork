## Summary

- Fix the `check()` helper function in `core/verify_mcp.py` to return `None` instead of an unused `bool` value
- Update the docstring to accurately describe the function's purpose (it prints a check description, not a context manager)

## Changes

The `check()` function previously:
- Returned `True` but the return value was never used by any caller
- Had a misleading docstring claiming it returned "a context manager for result"

Now it:
- Explicitly returns `None` (implicitly)
- Has an accurate docstring: "Print check description to stdout."

## Testing

- Verified Python syntax compiles correctly
- Ran ruff linter: all checks passed

Resolves #2133
