## Summary

Implements RFC #4038 - Agent Failure Taxonomy: a structured classification system that transforms raw failures into actionable evolution signals.

### Core Changes

**New Files:**
- `core/framework/schemas/failure_taxonomy.py` - Defines `FailureCategory` enum (10 categories), `EvolutionStrategy` enum (9 strategies), `ClassifiedFailure` model, and `FailureDistribution` model
- `core/framework/builder/failure_classifier.py` - `FailureClassifier` class using rules-first, LLM-fallback pattern following the HybridJudge approach
- `core/tests/test_failure_taxonomy.py` - Comprehensive test suite (26 tests, all passing)

**Modified Files:**
- `core/framework/schemas/run.py` - Added `classified_failure` field to `Run` model and `classified_failure_category` to `RunSummary`
- `core/framework/schemas/__init__.py` - Exported new taxonomy types
- `core/framework/builder/query.py` - Added `failure_distribution()`, `get_failures_by_category()`, `classify_all_failures()`, and enhanced `suggest_improvements()` with strategy-based recommendations
- `core/framework/runner/cli.py` - Added `hive failures` CLI command

### Failure Categories

| Category | Example | Evolution Strategy |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| `goal_ambiguity` | "Qualify leads" with no ICP definition | Refine the goal description |
| `tool_error` | Slack API rate-limited | Add retry/fallback logic |
| `routing_error` | Agent sent warm lead to cold outreach | Modify edge conditions |
| `output_quality` | Email draft had hallucinated stats | Add validation/grounding node |
| `cost_overrun` | Agent used GPT-4 for simple formatting | Switch to cheaper model |
| `timeout` | Sequential 8-node pipeline took 120s | Parallelize independent nodes |
| `hallucination` | Agent fabricated customer data | Add grounding/verification step |
| `constraint_violation` | Agent bypassed human-in-the-loop gate | Enforce constraint at edge level |
| `external_dependency` | External service unavailable | Add retry/fallback logic |
| `unknown` | Unclassifiable failure | Manual investigation |

### CLI Usage

```bash
# Show failure distribution
hive failures exports/my-agent

# Filter by category
hive failures exports/my-agent --category tool_error

# Show evolution strategy suggestions
hive failures exports/my-agent --suggest

# Output as JSON
hive failures exports/my-agent --json
```

### Why This Matters

1. **Evolution quality** - Structured failure types let the Builder make targeted decisions instead of guessing
2. **Product analytics** - Aggregate failure categories across users to understand framework investment needs
3. **User education** - Users learn which failure types their agents experience most
4. **Template benchmarking** - Compare quality across templates with actionable data

### Tests

All 26 tests pass:
- `TestFailureCategory` - 2 tests
- `TestEvolutionStrategy` - 1 test
- `TestCategoryToStrategyMapping` - 2 tests
- `TestClassifiedFailure` - 5 tests
- `TestFailureDistribution` - 6 tests
- `TestFailureClassifier` - 9 tests
- `TestRunWithClassifiedFailure` - 2 tests

Resolves #4038
