TITLE: [Feature]: Email Agent Integration Proposal for Hive Framework

BODY:
Hello Aden Team,

I would like to contribute to the Hive framework by building an Email Assistant Agent integration.

This agent will help automate email-related workflows such as:

- Reading incoming emails

- Classifying emails based on intent

- Generating intelligent replies

- Automating email responses based on defined workflows

I have previously worked on a LangGraph-based Email Assistant project and would like to adapt a similar agent using the Hive framework architecture.

This contribution aligns with the roadmap goals related to integrations, agent templates, and real-world business use cases.

I would like to know if this contribution would be valuable and if I can be assigned to work on this integration.

Looking forward to your guidance.

Thank you.
Found a possible duplicate of #2676: "[Feature]: Add Email Summarizer Sample Agent"

Both issues propose building an email processing agent for the Hive framework. Issue #2676 was recently completed (closed Jan 30, 2026) and implemented an Email Summarizer Sample Agent. 

You may want to check that implementation to see if it meets your needs. If you're interested in contributing a different variant or extending the existing email agent, please clarify how your proposal differs from the completed work.

If you disagree that this is a duplicate, feel free to react with a 👎 and provide additional context.
Hello Aden Team,


I understand that an Email Summarizer Sample Agent has already been implemented.

My proposal is different from the Email Summarizer agent. I would like to contribute a complete Email Assistant Agent that goes beyond summarization and includes:

• Email intent classification
• Automated reply generation
• Workflow-based response handling
• End-to-end email assistant functionality

This will act as a full Email Assistant example and demonstrate real-world business automation use cases.

I would be happy to extend the existing Email Summarizer agent or create an advanced Email Assistant agent based on your guidance.

Please let me know the preferred approach.

Thank you.
