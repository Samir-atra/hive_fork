# Docs: Concrete end-to-end example of agent evolution after a runtime failure

Resolves #4062

## Summary

This PR adds comprehensive documentation providing a concrete, step-by-step example of how Hive agents evolve after encountering failures at runtime. The new documentation addresses the issue raised in #4062 where users found it difficult to visualize what actually changes when an agent fails at runtime.

## Changes Made

### New Documentation

**`docs/key_concepts/evolution-example.md`** - A complete walkthrough including:
- **Step 1: Define the Goal** - Natural language goal for a Tech News Monitor agent
- **Step 2: Initial Agent Graph (v1.0)** - Shows the generated graph with 4 nodes, success criteria, and constraints
- **Step 3: Runtime Execution & Failure** - Documents a realistic failure scenario with execution trace and decision log
- **Step 4: Failure Diagnosis** - Explains the root cause analysis and recommended evolution
- **Step 5: Graph Evolution (v2.0)** - Shows the updated graph with new nodes, modified prompts, and changed edge conditions
- **Step 6: Re-Execution** - Demonstrates the evolved agent succeeding
- **Key Takeaways** - Summary of what evolution does and doesn't do

### Updated Documentation

- **`docs/key_concepts/evolution.md`** - Added reference link to the new concrete example
- **`docs/getting-started.md`** - Added evolution example to "Next Steps" section
- **`README.md`** - Added link to the evolution example in the Features section

## What the Example Demonstrates

1. **Initial Graph Generation** - Shows a 4-node graph: `search_news → filter_articles → summarize → send_email`

2. **Realistic Failure Scenario** - The `summarize` node fails due to:
   - API rate limiting
   - Paywall detection failure
   - Missing content from JavaScript-rendered pages

3. **Evolved Graph** - The v2.0 agent adds:
   - New `validate_content` node for content verification
   - Fallback mechanism for snippet-based summaries
   - `on_partial` edge conditions for graceful degradation

4. **What Changed and Why** - Explains the specific modifications:
   - Prompts updated for paywall awareness
   - New node for validation
   - Edge conditions for partial success

## Testing

- All documentation files are valid Markdown
- Cross-references between documents are correct
- No code changes - documentation only
